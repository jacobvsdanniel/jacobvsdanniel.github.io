His projects include Named Entity Recognition (NER) and sentiment analysis. From 2011 to 2017, Peng-Hsuan studied at the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University. He did research on human activity recognition under the supervision of prof. Hsu, Jane Yung-Jen. He and Yao-Hua Yang had a project on the analysis of the dataset of two month camera and various sensor recordings of a seminar room in their department building. From 2013 to 2016, Peng-Hsuan had several years of industrial experiences in both local system securities and internet securities. Experience Academia Sinica (2016~) Research Asistent. Research and develop a deep recursive neural system for both English and Chinese NER. Research and develop a neural model for Chinese phrase sentiment analysis. Trend Micro (2014~2016) Contract Engineer. QA of an application traffic scan engine. QA of a user-awareness module of an intrusion prevention system. QA of a TLS man-in-the-middle module of an intrusion prevention system. InfoKeyVault Technology (2013) Intern Engineer. Porting a security Windows file system to Linux virtual file system.
